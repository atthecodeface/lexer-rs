# lexer-rs

This provides stream management and a framework for context-free token
parsing, such as is required to parse languages.

This crate is in alpha; it is used in a small number of applications,
and the functionality is mature but the API is not yet stable, but may be enhanced.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
lexer-rs = "0.0.2"
```
